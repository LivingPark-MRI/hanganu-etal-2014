    "   1. **Difference in changes of cortical thickness between groups** \n",
    "    \n",
    "        - **PD-MCI** showed increased rate of overall cortical thinning compared with both PD-non-MCI and HC (Table 2).\n",
    "        \n",
    "            - **PD-MCI vs PD-non-MCI**: increased thinning was detected in the right temporal lobe (middle temporal gyrus, transverse temporal gyrus, temporal pole), the right insula, right inferior frontal gyrus and the right supplementary motor area (Figure 1). \n",
    "            \n",
    "            - **PD-MCI vs HC**: increased thinning was again detected in the right temporal lobe and right supplementary motor area. Additional significant clusters included the bilateral precuneus, bi- lateral cuneus, bilateral lingual, as well as right inferior parietal, right lateral occipital and left orbitofrontal region (Figure 1). \n",
    "            \n",
    "            - **PD-non-MCI vs HC**: an increased rate of thinning only in the left lateral occipital and left fusiform regions (Figure 1).\n",

Significant clusters were revealed in the temporal lobe bilaterally, the right occipital medial lobe and the left postcentral gyrus. Clusters of negative correlation were revealed in the anterior cingulate region in the All Parkinson’s disease group and in the transverse temporal gyrus in PD-MCI (Figure 2).\n",

    "<!-- LivingPark notebooks use a *cache* directory to store analysis inputs and outputs. Inputs typically include PPMI Study Data and imaging data whereas outputs include processed images and other derivatives. Cache directories allow LivingPark notebooks to run in a few minutes as they reuse previously computed results. However, cache directories cannot be made public due to the PPMI Data Usage Agreement (DUA). Instead, they are stored on `login.bic.mni.mcgill.ca`, which requires a specific user name and password. In case you don't have access to the cache directory of this notebook, the next sections will download all the required imaging data from PPMI and recompute the results, which will take a few hours depending on your computer configuration. In the future, we will aim at storing this cache dataset on PPMI servers so that they can be accessed with a PPMI account. -->\n",
